After a series of lectures about the fundamentals about GSAP.
We are no going to build an awesome project call the AI Chat.

This project is about a chat system that will respond according to 
input the that we give. The idea is to animate the interface 
based on certain events, for instance when we hover or click on 
this cool bolt button, the backgrond will be changed. We will 
implement loading animation while we wait for the response 
from the API.

And much more.
